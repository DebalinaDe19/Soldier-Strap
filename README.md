# Soldier-Strap
Soldier health Monitoring and Position tracking device.
This problem statement was given to us by DRDO on Smart India Hackathon portal.
The problem statement was to create a soldier strap which would be worn by the soldier during any critical time which would monitor the essential body parameters such as blood pressure, heart beats per minute, body temperature of the soldier.
Along with these, the device would be equipped with a SOS emergency button which would make AD hoc Wireless communication using a GPRS to the control station in case of any emergency situation occurs.
In order to track the live location, readings from the GPS would be taken.
All the base framework and skeleton of the project is made.
The final optimized product is under process.
